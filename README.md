# excel-to-pdf-invoices

DISCLAIMER

This program only works on Windows due to the use of the pywin module.

This is a program for an Amazon seller to get their order data and product description and produce pdf invoices for every client in an Amazon-produced xlsx sheet with all the relevant information. This usually happens at the end of the month and in my case it was tens of invoices that I would otherwise have had to work out manually. Although I tried to generalise it using a class, the code is pretty specific to my own case, where along with the Amazon seller sheet I also had my own product descriptions sheet and invoice template on Excel. 

Feel free to use the same structure and to borrow code in case you want to build your own program for the same or similar task.
